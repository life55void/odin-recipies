    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This vegan potato curry has abundant spices that make this better than any
      restaurant curry I've tasted.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

      <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>

      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>4 teaspoons curry powder</li>

      <li>4 teaspoons garam masala</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

      <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</li>

      <li>1 Â½ teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>

      <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained</li>

      <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>

      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>

      <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
        boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just
        tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir
        onion and garlic in hot oil until onion has softened and turned
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with curry powder, garam masala,
        cumin, salt, ginger, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cooked potatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and tomatoes, then pour in
        coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking for 5 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
